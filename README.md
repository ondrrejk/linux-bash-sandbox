# 🐧 Bash Playground

This repository is my personal sandbox for learning, experimenting, and practicing Bash scripting and Linux command‑line skills.  
Nothing here has to be work, this is where I break things, test ideas, and learn by doing.

## Purpose
The goal of this repo is to:
- Build up my real Bash scripting skills  
- Experiment...
- Learn Linux system administration concepts  
- Put my learned concepts to life by building practical use examples.

## How to Run
Rather don't


or atleast on a VM so you don't break your machine.
