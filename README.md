# 🐧 Bash Playground

This repository is my personal sandbox for learning, experimenting, and practicing Bash scripting and Linux command‑line skills.  
Nothing here has to be perfect, this is where I break things, test ideas, and learn by doing.

## What I'm Working On
This repo will contain small Bash projects such as:
- System monitoring tools  
- Backup scripts  
- User management automation  
- File operations  
- Anything else I want to experiment with  

## Purpose
The goal of this repo is to:
- Build up my real Bash scripting skills  
- Experiment...
- Learn Linux system administration concepts  
- Put my learned concepts to life by building practical use examples.

## How to Run
Instructions will be added as each project is implemented.

## Current Projects
**System Monitoring Script**  
A simple tool that displays CPU, RAM, and disk usage in a clean, readable format.
